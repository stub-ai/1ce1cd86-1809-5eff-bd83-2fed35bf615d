The system should trigger a cutscene when the player enters a specific area. During the cutscene, player movement and input should be disabled, and a pre-defined animation or sequence should play. Once the cutscene is over, control should be returned to the player.\n\nHere's what I need:\n1. A script to trigger the cutscene.\n2. A way to disable player controls during the cutscene.\n3. A method to play the cutscene (e.g., animation, camera movement).\n4. Code to re-enable player controls after the cutscene finishes.\n\nPlease provide the necessary Unity C# code to achieve this.","md5":"fdc4d29f5aeb6f1b60460d3bd8386c03"}]}
